# NOTES
#### Difference between forEach,map,filter functions
```
forEach(), map(), and filter() are all array methods in JavaScript that allow you to iterate over an array and perform certain operations.
```
1. forEach(): This method allows you to iterate over an array and execute a function for each element. It doesn't return anything and simply executes the function for each element.
2. map(): This method allows you to iterate over an array and transform each element using a function. It returns a new array with the transformed elements.
3. filter(): This method allows you to iterate over an array and filter out elements that don't meet a certain condition. It returns a new array with only the elements that pass the condition.
