#### Functions in JS
```
In JavaScript, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called from other parts of the code multiple times. Functions are used to modularize code, improve code reusability, and make code easier to maintain.

In JavaScript, there are several types of functions, each with its own purpose and syntax:

1.Function declaration:
function myFunction(param1, param2) {
  // Function body goes here
}
2.Function expression:
const myFunction = function(param1, param2) {
  // Function body goes here
}
3.Arrow function:
const myFunction = (param1, param2) => {
  // Function body goes here
}
```
