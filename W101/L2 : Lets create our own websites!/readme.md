The <img> tag in HTML is used to embed images into a webpage. It has the following syntax:

<img src="image_url" alt="alternative_text">
The src attribute specifies the URL of the image that you want to embed, while the alt attribute provides a text description of the image in case it cannot be displayed. The alt attribute is also used by screen readers to describe the image to visually impaired users.
```
#### Inspect element

"Inspect element" is a tool provided by modern web browsers that allows users to view and interact with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code of a webpage.
